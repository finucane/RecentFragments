Here are three chunks of code from a project that was part of a job in Santa Rosa that didn't pan out. My former boss said I could use this stuff as code samples for my resume.

This is just meant to be read by a programmer, it won't compile into anything that you can see.

AudioQueue is code that uses Audio Queue Services to record sound to a RAM buffer, which is pretty obscure but really just requires reading the Apple documentation.

NetworkLayer shows how to use NSURLConnection and NSOperationQueue as a basis for a little network stack that gives you reliability and error reporting and progress indication. It was written to fit underneath code that would have synced a core data object graph to a web service in boring, hard to get wrong, block-driven code.

PDFForms shows some PDF + UIKit stuff, there was a kind of API embedded in PDF forms coming from the server that the iOS code would use to implement forms by overlaying UITextFields and UIButtons on top of an underlying display of the PDF.
